# PRIPEL


## Requirements
To run our algorithm you need the following Python packages:
- SciPy (https://www.scipy.org)
- PM4Py (https://pm4py.fit.fraunhofer.de)
- IBM diffprivlib (https://diffprivlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

We did run our algorithm only with Python 3, so we can not guarantee that it works with Python 2.
